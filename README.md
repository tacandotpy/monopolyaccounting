This is a simple accounting code for the game of megalopolis created with the aid of Ai. It has some additional features that I have found helpful for playing a
more creative game. It is still in work and some features do not work as desired.
Changes will be made:
  "Changing the ownership of a property
  , Alliance mechanics
  , Joint ownership of properties
  , Automatic counting of the turns for keeping track of loans
  , Algorithm for government aid and taxes
  ,"Pass" mechanic and implementation of its function
  ,Evaluation algorithm for alliance option (similar to trade algorithm)
  ,Game-master assistant for equilibration between players"
  NOTE: manage_pass function is not in operation and the future can not be used. calculate_interest_rate function will
  be adjusted to give reasonable rates at the early-game period, event counter will be used to give weighted inflation
  rates until the majority of the properties are possesed by players.
